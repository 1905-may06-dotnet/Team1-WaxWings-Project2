## Project Proposal for Guns of Icarus Ladder

There is a problem with many multiplayer games where the games do not come with adequate support for competitive play.
Many multiplayer games lack a ladder system which ranks players, or teams, according to their skill. Players frequently create apps to facilitate these missing features.

Guns of Icarus is one such game missing these features.  Our application aims to rectify this by creating a web application that allows for users to record their team's wins and losses and create a ladder rank to distinguish the most skilled teams.

We will do this by allowing users to create accounts and join/create teams.  We then will let teams challenge each other and 
record the result of the match via the website.  Then, using business domain logic, the website will generate a page containing 
the ladder ranking of all teams for each of the game's various modes.
