Project Proposal for Guns of Icarus Ladder:

For too long, many multiplayer games are created without cater to competitive individuals. 
There is no in game system in place to distinguish exceptional players of high caliber - many multiplayer games lack a 
ladder system which ranks players according to their skill.

Guns of Icarus is such a game.  Our application aims to rectify this injustice by creating a web application that allows
for users to record each otherâ€™s wins and losses and create a ladder rank to distinguish the most skilled players.

We will do this by allowing users to create accounts and join/create teams.  We then will let teams challenge each other and 
record the result of the match via the website.  Then, using business domain logic, the website will generate a page containing 
the ladder ranking of all players, as well as allowing individual users to see their statistics.
